# SnakeRaven_IBVS_simulation
This code is a MATLAB simulation of the SnakeRaven vision system. Image Based Visual Servoing (IBVS) involves taking image features for measurements and computing the necessary camera motion. This MATLAB simulation does this with a virtual four dot target and builds on from the SnakeRaven simulator in repository: https://github.com/Andrew-Raz-ACRV/SnakeRavenSimulation

It also includes a variety of additional code for testing hand-eye calibration which may need Peter Corke's Robotic toolbox for MATLAB: https://github.com/petercorke/robotics-toolbox-matlab
